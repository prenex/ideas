When I have found out a very nice way in the SIGGRAPH documents to render decals, texts and vector graphics in low resulution textures it was great.

Later I have been thinking: "hmm if this works so greatly, and usually shadow map textures are low-poly why there is no solution to generate shadow maps utilizing these stuff?"

Basically the text and vector rendering works as follows:
- The textures does not contain the full shape or glyphs, but also contain blurry-looking edges.
- These edges are blurry in a way so that the blur is generated with knowlegde of the GPU filtering methods
- So basically we generate artifacts in the source texture so the result can be really sharp when it goes through the GPU hardware ;-)

This does not work well with colours and with general figures, but with text and "vector graphics" it works well.

HOWEVER! - here is the spin - I think shadow maps are really great for this purpuse and might be generated like these texts!

See the original decal / textz technique here:

I kind of feel it would work well with hard shadows...
